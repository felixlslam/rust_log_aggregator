# TODOs

- Change to use tokio web framework because the actix web framework requires a zstd dependency which has a special character (+) in its versions which may not be compatible with some organization's internal crates mirror
- Use text indexing for the log column in the database
- A rest API to search log
- Use a better logger
- Create a simple web UI to search log
